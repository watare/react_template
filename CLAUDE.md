# Project: Learning Web Development with AI

## Project Goal
This is a learning project to understand modern web development with:
- React + TypeScript (Frontend)
- FastAPI + Python (Backend)
- PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
- Apache Jena Fuseki (RDF Triplestore)
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## Learning Approach
- **Step-by-step progression** - understand each layer before adding the next
- **Explanation-first** - explain concepts before implementing
- **Document everything** - maintain BOOK.md as learning handbook
- **Question-driven** - ask "why" at each decision point

## Development Instructions
- Explain each step and technology choice
- Update BOOK.md with learnings as we progress
- Build incrementally: React → FastAPI → PostgreSQL → Auth/RBAC → RDF
- Use Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Focus on understanding over speed

## Deployment
- VPS: ubuntu@141.94.244.15 (SSH: ~/.ssh/ovh_rsa)
- Deploy only when explicitly requested
- Document deployment steps in BOOK.md

## Documentation
- **BOOK.md** - Main learning handbook (concepts, decisions, how-to)
- **JIRA/Confluence** - Track tasks and decisions (VPAC space)
- Atomic commits linked to JIRA tickets

## Current Phase
Phase 1: React Frontend (standalone with mock data)
